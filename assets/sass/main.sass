// 1. Abstracts (Variables, Mixins, Functions) - Load these first!
//    We use 'as *' here because main.sass itself might use vars directly,
//    and we want to avoid redundant prefixes in this top-level file.
//    However, as shown above, each sub-module will still @use 'abstracts/index' with a namespace.
@use 'abstracts/index.sass' as *

// 2. Base Styles (Resets, Typography)
@use 'base/index.sass' as *

// 3. Layout Styles (Global structural elements)
@use 'layout/index.sass' as *

// 4. Components (Reusable UI elements)
@use 'components/index.sass' as *

// 5. Pages (Page-specific styles)
@use 'pages/index.sass' as *

// Any global styles that don't fit into the above categories,
// or specific overrides/utilities, can go here.
